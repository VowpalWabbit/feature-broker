# feature-broker
Mature software applications are highly componentized and have well-defined API boundaries among components. This structure leads to constraints making in-process inference challenging due to the difficulty of access to features. The FeatureBroker library presents a solution to this problem. This work helped increase adoption of VW in inference.  We believe that this is a pervasive problem. The goal of open sourcing this library is to reduce the developer friction in adopting VW in software stacks that are built with these constraints.
